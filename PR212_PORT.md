# PR #212 Core Port

Reference: https://github.com/DSVVA/MHY_Scanner/pull/212

Pinned upstream head: 8dc8260a75553b3831fe5ebdbe3310917a48fd81.
Local base: loqwe/MHY_Scanner2 d07fc8018414e2b54962264517d8344601d825f2.

## Scope

This is an adapted core port, not a replacement with the upstream branch.
The upstream PR's UI, branding and dialogs are not imported. The local version
and dialogs are preserved. The main window was subsequently redesigned at the
user's request with an aligned, resizable local layout; see UI_LAYOUT.md.
The source also retains the preceding Issue #3 frame-conversion repair.
The later user-requested confirmation delay adds a seconds input;
see CONFIRMATION_DELAY.md.

- DXGI: select hardware with an attached desktop output, check HRESULTs,
  release COM objects/held frames, use read-only staging and copy by RowPitch.
- Screen scanning: bounded single-worker scanning, safe frame ownership,
  reuse the last valid image on unchanged desktops, and drain workers on exit.
- QR models: locate ScanModel relative to the EXE, validate all four files,
  report initialization failures, clear stale decoded output, and use scale 1.0.
- Live scanning: preserve safe first-frame conversion and four-plane swscale
  arguments; retain only the latest pending image; submit at most once per
  200ms, using tryStart with at most three workers and no growing queue.
- Stream IO: 5 MB probe, 2 second analysis, 1 MB receive buffer and the existing
  5 second IO timeout. A real FFmpeg interrupt callback handles cancellation
  and a 10 second initialization/no-decoded-video deadline. Audio packets do
  not refresh that deadline. The decode loop also checks it for buffered input.
- Scan status: report streaming only after a successfully converted frame.
  Preserve stop requests arriving before the stream thread starts.

## Local Behavior Preserved

- Query-based QR parsing, Panda bridge and two-stage passport confirmation.
- Existing account validation, account notes, row copying, full live-room links
  and the five-entry room history.
- The existing Bilibili parser already traverses stream/format/codec entries
  and prefers HTTP-FLV AVC. It is retained instead of the older upstream parser.
- No forced administrator manifest, raw QR/stream-address logging, desktop PNG
  dumps, upstream UI stylesheet/branding, protocol downgrade or version bump.
- Original application EXE, account files and user logs remain unchanged.

## Verification

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*safety.py"
python tests/test_scan_ui.py
cmake -S tests/stream_frame -B build/stream-frame -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DFFMPEG_ROOT="<shared FFmpeg SDK>"
cmake --build build/stream-frame --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/stream-frame -C Release --output-on-failure
cmake -S tests/screen_capture -B build/screen-capture -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build/screen-capture --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/screen-capture -C Release --output-on-failure
git diff --check
```

Verified with MSVC 19.44 x64 Release:
- 9 stream source guards and 3 existing-UI integration guards.
- Frame conversion/bounds/format changes, timing boundaries and reset.
- Actual FFmpeg blocked HTTP reads interrupted by timeout and cancellation,
  tested against a localhost server that sends headers but stalls the body.
  The stream suite also passes with the FFmpeg DLLs bundled with the user's EXE.
- RowPitch padding, buffer limits, invalid DXGI state, EXE-relative model paths
  and absent models; the existing four model files pass file validation.

The full Qt/OpenCV application has subsequently been compiled as an MSVC x64
Release EXE after installing the dependencies from the existing vcpkg baseline.
See BUILD_LOCAL.md and CONFIRMATION_DELAY.md for the current build and feature.
The original and portable runtime directories pass x64 PE import checks and
isolated 3-second startup checks. Real-model synthetic QR decoding also passes.
Actual GPU capture, real live-room decoding and account login confirmation
remain unverified; no user credentials are used by these tests.

The root pr212-core-port.patch is cumulative from the local base, including
the earlier Issue #3 repair. Do not apply it on top of issue3-live-crash-fix.patch.
The earlier standalone issue patch is kept separately and is not overwritten.
The later pr212-delay-build.patch also includes the delay and build adjustments.
